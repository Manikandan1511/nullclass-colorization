# Real-Time Video Colorization with Deep Learning

This project uses a trained deep learning model to colorize live grayscale video from your webcam in real-time. The GUI is built using Tkinter and OpenCV and offers a simple interface to visualize, capture, and interact with the colorized output.

## How to Run the Application

### Mac Users (Recommended)

> Double-click the `launch_colorization_gui.command` file to start the application.

If double-click doesn't work, make it executable:

chmod +x launch_colorization_gui.command
🛠️ Manual Execution via Terminal
bash
Copy
Edit
cd gui
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 colorization_gui.py

#### 🧠 Features
📹 Real-time webcam capture and colorization.

🖼️ Option to take screenshots of colorized frames.

📊 Displays real-time FPS (Frames Per Second).

💻 Clean GUI using Tkinter and PIL.

##### 💡 Requirements
This project uses a local virtual environment (.venv) with all dependencies pre-installed.

If you're setting up manually, install these:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python pillow
